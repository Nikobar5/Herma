**AI That Protects Your Data**


---

## Overview

Herma is a privacy-focused AI assistant that gives you complete control
over your data through intelligent, automatic routing. Define your privacy
 boundaries once‚ÄîHerma enforces them forever.

### The Problem

Every time you use cloud AI, you make an invisible trade: your
confidential information for convenience. Sensitive documents, private
thoughts, and proprietary data flow to distant servers where they may be
used for training, logging, or analysis beyond your control.

The alternative? Slow, limited local tools that can't match cloud AI's
capabilities.

**You shouldn't have to choose between power and privacy.**

### The Solution

Herma introduces **Data Governor Mode**‚Äîan intelligent routing system that
 automatically decides where your AI queries are processed based on rules
*you* define.

- **Sensitive query?** Processed 100% locally on your device. Zero
internet required.
- **General query?** Routed to powerful cloud models for maximum speed and
 quality.
- **You decide the rules.** Herma enforces them. Automatically. Every
time.

## Three Modes, Infinite Control

### üè∞ Local Mode
**Maximum Privacy. Zero Compromises.**

- All processing happens on your device
- Works completely offline
- Perfect for confidential work: legal documents, medical records,
financial data, competitive strategy
- Powered by Ollama with state-of-the-art local language models

### üõ°Ô∏è Governor Mode *(The Herma Difference)*
**Intelligence That Respects Your Boundaries.**

- Define your privacy constitution once (e.g., "Medical records and legal
docs = local only")
- Herma automatically routes each query to the appropriate processing
location
- Sensitive data stays local, general queries leverage cloud speed
- Best of both worlds with zero friction
- *(Experimental - always verify critical routing decisions)*

### üöÄ Cloud Mode
**Maximum Performance. Maximum Speed.**

- Direct access to cutting-edge cloud models via OpenRouter
- Fastest responses, highest quality output
- Perfect for creative work, research, brainstorming, and general queries
- No local privacy protection‚Äîuse when speed matters more than privacy

## Why Herma?

### You Own Your AI Interactions
Just like you own your devices, you should own your AI conversations.
Herma puts you in control of where your data goes and how it's processed.

### No More False Choices
Stop choosing between powerful AI and your privacy. Stop managing two
different tools. Stop second-guessing every query.

### Intelligence You Can Trust
Governor mode doesn't just blindly route traffic‚Äîit applies *your* rules
with precision. Set your boundaries once. Work with confidence forever.

### Privacy Without Paranoia
We're not anti-cloud. We're anti-*forced*-cloud. Sometimes speed matters
more than privacy. Sometimes privacy is non-negotiable. You decide. Every
time.

## The Herma Philosophy

**Autonomy Through Intelligence**

We believe AI should amplify your agency, not exploit your ignorance.
Every feature, every design decision, every line of code serves one
principle: **you are in control**.

- **Transparent by design:** You know exactly where your data goes
- **Local-first architecture:** Privacy is the default, not an
afterthought
- **No dark patterns:** Clear choices, honest trade-offs, respectful
design
- **Open about limitations:** Governor mode is experimental‚Äîwe tell you
that upfront

**This is AI that answers to you.**

## FAQ

**Q: Does Herma store my data?**
A: In Local mode, nothing ever leaves your device. In Governor/Cloud
modes, only queries you explicitly route to the cloud are sent to AI
providers. We never store or log your query content‚Äîonly metadata like
mode preferences.

**Q: What AI models does Herma use?**
A: Local mode uses Ollama (LLaMA 3, Mistral, etc.). Cloud mode uses
OpenRouter (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Pro, etc.). You control which
provider handles your data.

**Q: How accurate is Governor mode routing?**
A: Governor mode applies your constitution rules with precision, but it's
currently experimental. We recommend reviewing critical routing decisions
until you're confident in your rule set.

**Q: Can I use Herma completely offline?**
A: Yes! Local mode works 100% offline after initial model downloads.

**Q: Is my privacy constitution shared with anyone?**
A: No. Your constitution is stored locally on your device and optionally
synced to your private Firestore account (encrypted). We never see or
access it.

**Q: What happens if I switch from Cloud to Local mode?**
A: Context and conversation history remain available. Only the processing
location changes.
